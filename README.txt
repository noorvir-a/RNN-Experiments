Task 2
====================================================


make sure to run the metrics function (by setting RUN_METRICS to True) in Task2_2 before running save_images function. Not doing this will result in an error

To print testing loss, run T2_test.py with the RUN_TEST flag set to True. It will take some time to build the graph after which the test loss will be printed. You can then quit the program as it will start to predict the entire model pixel by pixel.
