### RNN-Experiments

This repository contains code for some of my early experiments with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - LSTMs and GRUs. The experiments are applied on image data - since its easier to understand intuitively. They include:

* [Classification](https://github.com/noorvir-a/RNN-Experiments/tree/master/classification)
* [Pixel-prediction](https://github.com/noorvir-a/RNN-Experiments/tree/master/pixel_prediction)
* [In-painting](https://github.com/noorvir-a/RNN-Experiments/tree/master/in_painting)


I recommend using this code only for reference; I wrote it a while ago for personal use only.
